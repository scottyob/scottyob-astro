Makes two

## Ingredients
* 1 egg yolk
* 1 tbsp water
* 1/2 tbsp lemon juice
* 4 tbsp (1/2 block) butter
* 1/8 tsp salt (just a pinch)
* 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper (just a sprinkle)

## Method
* In a big bowl, whisk together the egg yolk, water, and lemon juice.
* Cut butter into small pieces and add to the bowl.
* Place the bowl over a pot of simmering water (double boiler) and whisk until the butter melts and the sauce thickens.  Should become gravy, will thicken as it cools too!
* Season with salt and cayenne pepper.
