This one came from [Once Upon a Chef](https://www.onceuponachef.com/recipes/chocolate-chip-pecan-blondies.html)

NOTE:  Will come out looking terribly under-done.  Trust me, it firms up.

## Ingredients
* 1 stick (½ cup) unsalted butter, melted  
* ½ cup packed dark brown sugar  
* ⅓ cup granulated sugar  
* 1 large egg  
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract  
* 1 cup all‑purpose flour (spooned & leveled)  
* ½ teaspoon salt  
* ¾ cup semisweet chocolate chips  
* ½ cup chopped pecans (optional, any nuts really)

## Method
1. Preheat oven to **350 °F**. Line an 8‑inch square pan with parchment, leaving a 2‑inch overhang.
2. In a large bowl, beat melted butter with brown and granulated sugars for about 2 minutes until combined.  
3. Add egg and vanilla; beat until smooth.  
4. Mix in flour and salt on low speed, just until blended.  
5. Fold in chocolate chips and pecans.  
6. Spread batter evenly in pan with a spatula.  
7. Bake 25 minutes, until edges are golden and center is just set (slightly soft is fine).  
8. Cool completely in the pan on a wire rack. Use the parchment overhang to lift blondies out, then slice into 16 squares.
