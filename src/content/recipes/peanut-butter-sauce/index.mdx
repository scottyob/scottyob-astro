## Notes:
From: https://cookieandkate.com/peanut-dipping-sauce/#tasty-recipes-23875-jump-target

I've used it for a stir fry too with just more water (or coconut milk)

## Ingredients
* ¾ cup creamy peanut butter
* ¼ cup rice vinegar
* ⅓ cup reduced sodium tamari or reduced-sodium soy sauce
* 3 tablespoons honey
* 1 ½ teaspoons grated fresh ginger or ½ teaspoon ground ginger
* 1 to 2 medium cloves garlic, pressed or minced, to taste
* ¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes, plus more for sprinkling
* 2 to 4 tablespoons water or coconut milk, or as necessary to reach your desired consistency
* Optional garnishes: sprinkling of chopped roasted peanuts and additional red pepper flakes

## Method
* Mix everything in a 2-cup measuring cup.  I've used the stick blender before here.
