        ## Skills
    </header>
    <div class="blockSection">
        ### Incident Response
        - Bringing the affected teams together to find and plan a mitigation path during outages in network and software incidents of various sizes, bringing multiple datasets into timelines to clearly show cause and effect and determine the root cause.
        - Direct teams in coming up with prevention and recovery plans to make the infrastructure more resilient.

        ### Network Engineering
        - Experience operating large-scale networks in data center and edge in running both traditional routing protocols (BGP, IS-IS) and home-grown ([OpenR](https://github.com/facebook/openr)) across various network operating systems (FBOSS, Arista EOS, Junos)
        - Experience building and operating IPv6 networks, including IPv4 over IPv6 transports (RFC5549, RFC8950, RFC4884, RFC5837)
        - Ability to use big data (Hive and Presto) to data-mine loss characteristics across topologies and server/NIC generations to find common denominators of issues.

        ### Software Development
        - Building software and tooling to monitor and control routers in large-scale environments.
        - Ability to adapt across programming languages and code bases for full stack features. Most comfortable with Python, TypeScript and React. Experience with C++ and Go.
        - Collaborate across teams to plan large pipelines for managing network deployment automation.
        - Writes across full stack from backend services, to network control plane features, to frontend React interactive experiences.

        ### Linux
        - Ansible for configuration management, Docker for deploying services and containers.
        - htop and below for historical troubleshooting.
        - cgroup for shared resource control.

        I love the challenge of seeing a problem, and coming up with product centric self-serve solutions. I enjoy operations, working with my team to ensure our alarming and processes are scalable. I‚Äôve always strived to automate myself out of a job. I hate unanswered questions. Building and collecting metrics to deep dive into problems has always been a passion of mine.

        ## Experience
    </header>
    <div class="blockSection">
        <h2 class="jobTitle">Facebook (Meta) <span class="jobRole">Production Network Engineer</span></h2>
        <div class="jobDate">July 2015 - June 2024 (9 years), Menlo Park, CA, USA</div>

        Easily the pinnacle of my career so far. Spent 9 years building and exercising my skills in Network Engineering, Software Development and Data Analytics working across multiple teams to help build and scale Meta‚Äôs Network Infrastructure.

        ### Network Infrastructure Engineer
        - Built alarms and remediation to scale the automated management across Facebook‚Äôs Datacenter, Backbone and Edge Networks.
        - Built the Drain and audit frameworks to ensure the safe removal and insertion of network devices in all devices roles across the production network.
        - Built data pipelines to show issues with the convergence timing of our MPLS/RSVP network after fiber cut events.
        - Ran incident response for issues across both network and software tools.
        - Deployed and managed multiple [Terragraph](https://terragraph.com) instances to operationalize and harden the product.

        ### Network Deployment Integration
        - Partnered with edge and backbone teams, built tooling and workflows to make their turnup and migration processes more consistent and reliable.
        - Worked with partner Software Development Teams developing the workflow orchestration systems to help productionize their service. Add monitoring, find bottlenecks, and integrate with wider Facebook tooling to increase the responsiveness and reliability of their service.

        ### Datacenter Network Engineer
        - Built tooling to integrate different teams databases to detect physical cable faults and create the appropriate followup actions.
        - Designed [and implemented](https://github.com/facebook/fboss/commit/f898646026937540f6ca5174df7997e85e52e61a) RFC4884 and RFC5837 on FBOSS network OS to retain IPv4 traceroute functionality across newer V6-only deployments.
        - Built tooling to parse verbose FBOSS switch ASIC state logs, extracting millisecond-granular data on resource usage, convergence timing, and routing micro-loops. This reduced time to triage hard-to-root-cause incidents, aided qualification efforts, and helped identify bottlenecks to inform future network design roadmaps.
        - Implemented action plan to bring on-call alarming down to acceptable levels.
        - Ran multiple Datacenter related incident investigations and mitigations.
