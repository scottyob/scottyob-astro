        ## Skills
    </header>
    <div class="blockSection">
        ### Incident Response
        - Ability to manage network and software incidents of various sizes.  Involves bringing in the effected teams together on video bridges or incident chats, finding and planning a mitigation path during outages and root causing why we're seeing outages or issues.  Troubleshooting often involves working with multiple parties to bring in multiple datasets into timelines to clearly show cause and effect.
        - Help teams come up with recovery and prevention plans to make our infrastructure more resilient.

        ### Network Engineering
        - Experience operating large-scale networks in data center and edge in running both traditional routing protocols (BGP, IS-IS) and home-grown ([OpenR](https://github.com/facebook/openr)) daemons.
        - Experience building and operating IPv6 networks, operating IPv4 over IPv6 infrastructure (RFC5549, RFC8950, RFC4884, RFC5837)
        - Ability to use big data (Hive and Presto) to data-mine loss characteristics across topologies and server/NIC generations to find common denominators of issues.

        ### Software Development
        - Experience building software and tooling to monitor and control routers in large-scale environments.
        - Ability to adapt across programming languages and code bases for full stack features.
        - Collaborate across teams to plan large pipelines for managing network deployment automation.
        - Writes across full stack from backend services, to network control plane features, to frontend React interactive experiences.

        ### Linux
        - Ansible for configuration management, Docker for deploying services and containers
        - htop and below for historical troubleshooting
        - Basic cgroup for shared resource control

        I've always loved the challenge of seeing a problem, and coming up with solutions.  I've always enjoyed operations work, working with my team to ensure our alarming and processes are scalable.  I've always strived to automate myself out of a job.  I hate unanswered questions.  Building and collecting metrics to deep dive into problems has always been a passion of mine.

        ## Experience
    </header>
    <div class="blockSection">
        <h2 class="jobTitle">Facebook (Meta) <span class="jobRole">Production Network Engineer</span></h2>
        <div class="jobDate">July 2015 - June 2024 (9 years), Menlo Park, CA, USA</div>

        Easily the pinnacle of my career so far.  Spent 9 years building and exercising my skills in Network Engineering, Software Development and Data Analytics working across multiple teams over my tenure here to help build and scale Meta's Network Infrastructure.

        ### Network Infrastructure Engineer
        - Built alarms and remediation to scale the automated management across Facebook's Datacenter, Backbone and Edge Networks.
        - Built the Drain and audit frameworks to ensure the safe removal and insertion of devices from the Facebook production network, across Datacenter and Backbone.
        - Built data pipelines to show issues with the convergence timing of our MPLS/RSVP network after fiber cut events.
        - Ran incident response for a number of issues across both network and software tools.
        - Deployed and managed multiple [Terragraph](https://terragraph.com) instances to help operationalize and harden the product.

        ### Network Deployment Integration
        - Partnered with edge and backbone teams, built tooling and workflows to make their turnup and migration processes more consistent and reliable
        - Worked with partner Software Development Teams developing the workflow orchastration systems to help productionize their service.  Add monitoring, find bottlenecks, and integrate with wider Facebook tooling to increase the responsiveness and reliability of their service.

        ### Datacenter Network Engineer
        - Built tooling integrate different teams databases to detect physical cable faults and create the appropriate followup actions.
        - Designed [and implemented](https://github.com/facebook/fboss/commit/f898646026937540f6ca5174df7997e85e52e61a) RFC4884 and RFC5837 on FBOSS network OS to retain IPv4 traceroute functionality across newer V6-only deployments.
        - Built tooling to parse verbose FBOSS switch ASIC state logs, extracting ms-granular data on resource usage, convergence timing, and identify routing micro-loops and convergence times.  This helped triage hard to root cause incidents, aided in qualifications, and help show bottlenecks across our current network design to shape future roadmaps.
        - Helped team take control of on-call burden, action plan with partner teams to bring alarming down to acceptable levels.
        - Ran multiple Datacenter related incident investigations and mitigations.

        <h2 class="jobTitle">University of Wollongong <span class="jobRole">Network Engineer</span></h2>
        <div class="jobDate">June 2012 - Sep 2014 (2 years 4 months), Wollongong, NSW, Australia</div>

        Worked primarily as a Network Engineer and Software Developer to keep the university campus and datacenter networks operating smoothly and help improve process in the organization through the development of software.  Work here involved:
        - management and improvement to their multi-campus MPLS VPN core
        - Deployment of open source tools such as NetDisco and Rancid, and scripting to improve change management processes
        - Evolution of internet services, such as building a quota and proxy "Free Internet" with BGP community based shaping rules to network appliances to satisfy business financial needs, along with [Traffic Attribution](https://uowits.github.io/herbert-gui/) tools for the business to understand usage and costs down to a per-subscriber breakdown.
        - Design network migration and lab changes to migrate to newer Palo Alto based firewalls for allowing inter-vrf routing.

        <h2 class="jobTitle">University of Wollongong <span class="jobRole">Academic Tutor</span></h2>
        <div class="jobDate" />

        Roles were assisting student with lab tasks, providing class assistance and demonstrations to assisnt teach course material and help students develop their programming skills.  Marked exams and provided feedback.  Subjects tutored were:
        - Procedural Programming (March 2009 - June 2010) 
        - Interacting Systems (March-June 2010)
        - Systems Administration (March-June 2013)

        <h2 class="jobTitle">UTBox <span class="jobRole">Systems Engineer</span></h2>
        <div class="jobDate">January 2011 - June 2012 (1 year 6 months), Sydney, NSW, Australia</div>

        Job role was very diverse given the small startup nature of the company.  Given the volume of marketing fax through the platform, the job was technically interesting.  My role was primarily around managing the infrastructure to ensure everything from the network stack, to database and webservers were highly available and managed through configuration management to ensure a failure would not result in a loss of revenue.  Day to day operations were also to support clients and help with fixing bugs or developing new features for the product.
